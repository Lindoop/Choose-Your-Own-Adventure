# Choose-Your-Own-Adventure
A text-based adventure game that was done in Grade 12 Computer Science with the Java language

First, you pick your "class": Noble, Wizard, Witch, Ranger, Peasant, and Fairy. Each class has their stats and what they excel at (e.g. Witches have higher damage, but less health, while Rangers deal lower damage, but have more health). Each class also has their own stories to embark on. 

Throughout your journey, there will be instances where you will be thrown into conflict and be forced to enter the combat stage. It's an easy basic combat system coded in a way that the only way you lose is if you don't attack, just because this game was more for the text-based adventure, not the combat (that was just an add-on to meet criteria in the original assignment). 

The stories were all self-created with a partner on the project, and it was purely a fun assignment
